## 3. How We Use Information

### 3.1 Primary Uses

## 4. Data Storage and Security

### 4.1 Local Storage

When you use GitHub features:
- We interact with GitHub's API
- Your use of GitHub is subject to GitHub's Privacy Policy
- We only access data you explicitly authorize
- We respect GitHub's API rate limits and terms

### 5.2 Dependencies
The application uses open-source libraries. Each dependency has its own privacy practices, but none collect personal data through our application.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

### 6.1 Access and Control
You can:
- Revoke GitHub OAuth tokens at any time
- Delete local configuration files
